      [Rymnik.] Made a transition to Rymnik on horseback. [[5]] The old man still doesn't bow to me.
      Both of these things annoy me. Behaved well with encountered bashi-bazouks. Had a conversation
      with Kryzhanovsky. He, for some reason, advises me to be seconded to the Cossack battery;
      advice that I won't follow. Argued heatedly in the evening with Frieda and Babarykin, scolded
      Sergey Putovsky, and didn't accomplish anything. These are the three reproaches I have for
      myself for today. (3)

      My correction is going splendidly. I feel how my relationships become pleasant and easy with
      people of all kinds, since the time I decided to be modest and convinced myself that always
      appearing majestic and infallible is not necessary. I am very cheerful. And God grant, as it
      seems to me, that this cheerfulness comes from within me; from the desire to be pleasant to
      everyone, modesty, non-offensiveness, and attentiveness to flashes. Then I would always be
      cheerful and almost always happy. In the morning, I had decided to stay at home, study, but
      things didn't go well and I couldn't resist going out in the evening to wander. On the way
      back from dinner, Tishkevich and I stopped by the brothel and Kryzhanovsky caught us, which, I
      admit, was not entirely pleasant for me. I blame myself for being indecisive and not staying
      at home, and for idleness throughout the day. That's the main point. (2)

      I am writing in a very pleasant and cheerful state of mind, in which I spent the entire
      evening. In the morning, I read, had pears for lunch, and instead of a proper meal, I ate
      cheese. Despite the celebrations at Stalypin's and Sergey Putovsky's on the occasion of
      receiving awards, I didn't envy, but had a cheerful day. In the evening, I grabbed my
      slippers, had two glasses of champagne with Schwartz, Veilerovsky [?], and Hembich, then
      chatted with Shubin and Sasha Gorchakov. Apart from the festivities, I am very satisfied with
      my day. (1)
